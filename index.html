I have a passion for design and research, and can’t wait to share my knowledge with others! My creative process and leadership style is shown below. Check it out!

    <center><h3>What is creativity?</h3></center><br /><p>Creativity means something different for everyone. One of the generally accepted definitions of creativity is being able to think outside of box. A professor once asked me, “what’s inside of the box?” I hadn’t really thought about it that way. He said that what we already know is in the box. If we really wanted to be creative, we needed to leave our assumptions behind and move beyond what we’re familiar with. </p>

          		<p>"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things."</p>

                    <p class="small"><b>To me</b>, creativity is the ability to become a child again. When I was a kid, I remember asking my parents a lot of questions because I was curious about the world. I played with my toys all day long and used my imagination to create things that didn’t exist. With creativity, there are no boundaries or shaming. You have to be open to new ideas.</p>

                <center><h3>My Creative Process</h3></center><br />
                <p>My creative process has five steps. First, I have to internalize and visualize what I’m going to do. Then, I do my homework by researching. I then let the idea sit and incubate. I research again for good measure. Finally, the idea goes into the experimentation phase where I find out if the idea works or not. If it doesn’t work, then I start the process all over again.</p>

While group work isn’t always easy, I found that there are some key components to a successful team:</p>

                <center><h3>Leadership</h3></center><br />
                <p>Leadership is an ongoing learning experience. As a graduate student and teaching assistant, I had to opportunity to lead on multiple occasions. I had to figure out how to address problems, meet deadlines, and communicate with people from all over the world. I now know that I am an <b>introverted leader</b>. I am quiet, but I make a conscious effort to contribute to the conversation. I make sure that my thoughts are heard and that my introverted group members are heard as well.</p>
                <p>I am also a <b>collaborative leader</b>. I establish rapport with my group members and ask them about their personality types. I make sure that everyone knows what they are doing and understands the goals of the project. I use several forms of communication in case someone did not understand what was being discussed in the group. No major decisions are implemented without consulting my team first. If a problem arises, then it has to be addressed as soon as possible. To me, being a good leader is not about leading people; it’s about collaboration and maintaining a healthy group atmosphere.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <p>A good leader welcomes <b>creativity</b> and negates negativity. As previously stated, leadership is a never-ending experience. There is always room for improvement. My leadership style changes constantly, and I will continue to learn and never stop learning.</p>
